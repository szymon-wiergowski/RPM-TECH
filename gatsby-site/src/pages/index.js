    <p>Welcome to your new Gatsby site.</p>
    <p>Now go build something great.</p>
    <p>
      For what it's worth I had this same issue and it came down to a
      case-sensitivity issue. It worked fine on my mac but failed on Netlify's
      servers because of some of the component names:
    </p>
    <div style={{ maxWidth: `300px`, marginBottom: `1.45rem` }}>
      <Image />
    </div>
    <Link to="/page-2/">Go to page 2</Link>
  </Layout>
)

export default IndexPage
